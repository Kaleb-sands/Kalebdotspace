    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This shack can be found in two ways. The first is to enter the end of goat path from the bend on Lazy River, drop into the woods and hug left until you are near the edge of Right Stuff. From here simply ski down until you see the shack about 30 feet from the left side of Right Stuff. The second way is to just hug the left side of Right Stuff until you see it in the woods.</p>
