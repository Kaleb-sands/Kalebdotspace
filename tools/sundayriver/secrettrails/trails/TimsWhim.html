    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Tim's Whim can be found off of Locke Mountain. The First entrance is from Bim's Whim by taking a left towards the top near the radio tower. From here head down until either a red blaze is seen or a cutout glade. The second entrance is from T-2. On the right side of T-2 across from Jim's Whim, there is a small path which you can follow directly across to the trail. Follow this straight down exiting onto T-2 on the left, or salvation on the right.</p>
